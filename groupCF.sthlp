{cmd:aweight}s, {cmd:fweight}s, {cmd:iweight}s, and {cmd:pweight}s are allowed {it: but} will not be treated like Stata treats weights. Instead they will be used as the {cmd: sample.weights} argument in {cmd: grf::causal_forest}. Note that the {cmd: grf::causal_forest} weights option is experimental.

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:groupCF} performs the Causal Forest algorithm using the {cmd: causal_forest} algorithm in R's {cmd: grf} (Athey, Tibshirani, & Wager, 2019). It then takes the predicted individual-level estimates and turns them into quantiles, and returns the quantiles as a variable to Stata. It is strongly recommended that you read the {cmd: grf::causal_forest} help file, which you can do with {cmd: rcall: help(causal_forest, package = 'grf')} after running {help groupCFsetup}.

{pstd}
Before running {cmd: groupCF}, you must install R and then set up some packages in both Stata and R. You can do this by first installing R from {browse: "R-project.org":R-Project.org}, and then running the {help groupCFsetup} command. Or if you prefer you can do this yourself, installing R, setting up {help rcall} using the instructions in {browse "https://doi.org/10.1177/1536867X19830891": Hagish (2019)}, and then installing {MagnifiedIV} in R with {cmd: rcall: install.packages('remotes')} followed by {cmd: rcall: remotes::install_github('NickCH-K/MagnifiedIV')}.

{pstd}
Syntax takes the form of {help depvar} {help indvar} {help varlist}. {help depvar} is the dependent variable being predicted ({cmd: Y} in {cmd: grf::causal_forest} syntax). {help indvar} is the treatment variable you are interested in seeing treatment effect heterogeneity for ({cmd: W}), and {help varlist} is the list of variables used to predict treatment effect heterogeneity. These should be variables in Stata and not matrices; {cmd: groupCF} will convert them to matrices for {cmd: grf::causal_forest} use.
